A point will be created at the intersection in the chosen layer (settings).\r\n* **advanced intersection**: this tool can be used to intersect 2 or more observations (distance or observations) using a least-square adjustment. Once finished, it will also create dimension for each observation.\r\n\r\n### Dimensions\r\n\r\nOnce the advanced intersection is found, if defined in settings, the dimensions will be written in chosen layer.\r\nArcs are drawn for distance and lines are drawn for orientations.\r\nThey can be edited using the corresponding icons.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
